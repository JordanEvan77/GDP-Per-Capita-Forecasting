# GDP-Per-Capita-Forecasting
Using simple and complex models to forecast time series data. The goal of this group project was to confirm if the growth rate of Ireland's Per Capita GDP was sustainable coming out of the pandemic. We used an integrated ARIMA model for our final selection model after test/train split trials and checking for other statistical signifigance.

To run the code, I would recommend running the cleaning data file first, and then focus on the Final_code file for the analysis of the time series, and the visuals. The final paper RMD should produce a PDF of the paper reflecting on our findings that we submitted for this project as well.
